# wikiLYNX 

A simple browser app made using Qt C++ to play wikipedia speedruns the right way. The project was initially made for the wikiLYNX event conducted by [@jonesrison](https://github.com/jonesrison) at RSET, Kerala. Documentation is under maintenance. 

## Introduction

Wikipedia, one of the world's largest online encyclopedia is sort of a universe of hyperlinks. Deviating from a main article we were supposed to research for our assignment/project to an article completely different from our initial plans is not an uncommon experience. This experience slowly developed into a game. The player will be given an initial Wikipedia article from which one should find another article,  perhaps completely unrelated to the initial topic, only through hyperlinks in the page. This game though not probably recognised by any internation organisation, is commonly known folks among social media as Wikipedia Speedrun. 
wikiLYNX is a game browser designed to let everyone play this game the right way. The browser let's you play the game with certain rules with place making this an oppurtunity to test oneself among one's acquaintances. The app is a simple C++ app based on Qt Framework. If one happens to be someone interested in the game, one is invited to play the game and contribute to the development of this project.
